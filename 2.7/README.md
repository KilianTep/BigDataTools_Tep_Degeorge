###2.7 \
The objective of this exercice is to display the year and the height of each tree of the file arbres.csv. \ 
This file describes the amazing trees of Paris (from http://opendata.paris.fr. \ 
For this, you will have to build a new Eclipse project named YearHeightTree by copying/pasting the previous one \
and refactoring (renaming) it. In this project, we will have to build a class named Tree used to represent one of the line of the file \
(that corresponds to one tree). Try to build it in such a way that it will not be instanciated.
